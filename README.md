# Abstract Classes
Abstract classes and methods are when the parent class has a named method but the child class needs to complete the task.

An abstract class is a class that contains at least one abstract method. Abstract methods are methods that are declared in your code but not implemented.

We can define an Abstract class or method with the abstract keyword.
